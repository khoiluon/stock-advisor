/**
 * Defines the default configuration for the Fibonacci Retracement tool.
 *
 * **Tutorial Note:**
 * This tool is structurally complex because it generates many visual elements from just two points.
 * These defaults include:
 * 1. **Levels:** An array of coefficients (0, 0.236, 0.382, etc.) with their associated colors and opacities.
 * 2. **Extension:** Configuration to extend all level lines infinitely to the left or right.
 * 3. **Trade Strategy:** A placeholder structure for advanced trading setups (Entry/Stop/Target) linked to Fib levels.
 *
 * Reusing these defaults ensures that any new Fib tool starts with the standard industry levels.

 * **What is a Fibonacci Retracement?**
 * It is a tool used to identify potential support and resistance levels. It is defined by
 * a "Trend Line" connecting two extreme points (usually a high and a low).
 *
 * **Logic Overview:**
 * The tool calculates the vertical distance between P0 and P1 and then draws horizontal
 * lines at specific percentages (coefficients) of that distance.
 *
 * **Inheritance:**
 * It extends `BaseLineTool` directly. While it shares the 2-point requirement of a Trend Line,
 * its rendering and culling logic are entirely unique, necessitating a distinct model and view.
